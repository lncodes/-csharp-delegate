<h2 id="introduction">🌟 Introduction</h2>

This repository demonstrates the use of C# Delegate through a simple console application. In this repository, delegates are used to manage callbacks for inventory actions, such as adding or removing items. By using delegates, methods can be encapsulated as objects, allowing them to be passed as parameters, stored in variables, and invoked dynamically at runtime, which improves modularity, reduces redundancy, and ensures type safety of the code.
